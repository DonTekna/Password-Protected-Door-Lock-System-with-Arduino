# Password-Protected-Door-Lock-System-with-Arduino
This Arduino code manages a door lock system where users enter a password via a keypad. If the password is correct, the servo motor unlocks the door and a buzzer sounds. Incorrect passwords trigger an error message on the LCD, and the system resets.
